A public concept for an automated shoe sole cleaning device
Modular Shoe Sole Cleaning Device 
This concept introduces a fixed, modular shoe sole cleaning device designed to be installed at
entrances of high-traffic spaces such as:
- Residential and commercial complexes
- Hospitals, clinics, and medical offices
- Shops and service units
- Entrance to sports halls
The goal is to prevent outdoor dirt, grease, and germs from being carried indoors by cleaning the
soles of shoes in an efficient, hygienic way.
Main Features
- Powered by electricity and permanently installed on-site
- Utilizes rotating brushes, water, air blowers, and specialized cleaning agents to remove dust, dirt,
oil, and grease
- Designed for all kinds of shoes and soles
- Each device can be tailored to the specific needs of the installation location (e.g., medical-grade
solutions for hospitals)
- Promotes hygiene and cleanliness, especially in medical and commercial spaces
Environmental Design
 Optional features include low-water usage systems and recycling units
- Energy-efficient components to reduce power consumption
- Modular design allows for scalable production and easy maintenance
